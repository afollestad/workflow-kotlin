/**
 * The props must be specified, the initial state may be specified, and then all child workflows
 * and workers that are expected to run, and any outputs from them, must be specified with
 * [expectWorkflow] and [expectWorker] calls. Then call [render] and perform any assertions on the
 * rendering. An event may also be sent to the rendering if no workflows or workers emitted an
 * output. Lastly, the [RenderTestResult] returned by `render` may be used to assert on the
 * [WorkflowAction]s processed to handle events or outputs by calling
 * [verifyAction][RenderTestResult.verifyAction] or
 * [verifyActionResult][RenderTestResult.verifyActionResult].
 *
 * - All workflows that are rendered/ran by this workflow must be specified.
 * - Workers are optionally specified. Specified workers must run. Unexpected workers on a render
 *   pass do not cause a test failure.
 * - It is an error if more than one workflow or worker specifies an output.
 * - It is a test failure if any workflows or workers that were expected were not ran.
 * - It is a test failure if the workflow tried to run any workflows that were not expected.
 * - It is a test failure if no workflow or workflow emitted an output, no rendering event was
 *   invoked, and any of the action verification methods on [RenderTestResult] is called.
 *
 * ## Examples
 *
 * ### Worker output
 *
 * The following example tests a render pass that runs one worker, `SubmitLoginWorker`, which
 * is configured to have "emitted" an output, and one workflow, `ChildWorkflow`, which expects a
 * props containing "test@foo.com" and returning a `ChildRendering` as its rendering.
 *
 * It checks that the rendering properties are expected and that the output handler for the
 * `SubmitLoginWorker` returned the `CompleteLogin` action.
 *
 * ```
 * workflow
 *   .renderTester(
 *     props = MyProps(…),
 *     initialState = MyState(…)
 *   )
 *   .expectWorker(
 *     matchesWhen = { it is SubmitLoginWorker },
 *     key = "signin",
 *     output = WorkflowOutput(LoginResponse(success = true))
 *   )
 *   .expectWorkflow(
 *     workflowType = ChildWorkflow::class,
 *     key = "child",
 *     assertProps = { assertThat(it.email).isEqualTo("test@foo.com") },
 *     rendering = ChildRendering("message")
 *   )
 *   .render { rendering ->
 *     assertThat(rendering.text).isEqualTo("foo")
 *   }
 *   .verifyAction { action ->
 *     assertThat(action).isEqualTo(Action.CompleteLogin(success = true))
 *   }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Rendering event
 *
 * This is similar to the example above, but will test an event sent to the rendering instead.
 *
 * ```
 * workflow
 *   .renderTester(
 *     props = MyProps(…),
 *     initialState = MyState(…)
 *   )
 *   .expectWorker(
 *     matchesWhen = { it is SubmitLoginWorker },
 *     key = "signin"
 *   )
 *   .expectWorkflow(
 *     workflowType = ChildWorkflow::class,
 *     key = "child",
 *     assertProps = { assertThat(it.email).isEqualTo("test@foo.com") },
 *     rendering = ChildRendering("message")
 *   )
 *   .render { rendering ->
 *     rendering.onCancelClicked()
 *     assertThat(rendering.text).isEqualTo("foo")
 *   }
 *   .verifyAction { action ->
 *     assertThat(action).isEqualTo(Action.CancelLogin)
 *   }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Verify action result
 *
 * This test verifies the action _result_ instead of the action itself. This technique is useful
 * if the [WorkflowAction] is anonymous or inline.
 *
 * ```
 * val currentState = …
 * val previousState = …
 *
 * workflow
 *   .renderTester(
 *     props = MyProps(…),
 *     initialState = currentState
 *   )
 *   .render { rendering ->
 *     rendering.onCancelClicked()
 *   }
 *   .verifyActionResult { newState, output ->
 *     // Check that the workflow navigated back correctly.
 *     assertThat(newState).isEqualTo(previousState)
 *
 *     // Check that the workflow didn't emit any output from the button click.
 *     assertThat(output).isNull()
 *   }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Too many outputs
 *
 * This is an example of what **not** to do – this test will error out because a worker is emitting
 * and output _and_ a rendering event is sent.
 *
 * ```
 * workflow
 *   .renderTester(
 *     props = MyProps(…),
 *     initialState = MyState(…)
 *   )
 *   .expectWorker(
 *     matchesWhen = { it is SubmitLoginWorker },
 *     key = "signin",
 *     output = WorkflowOutput(LoginResponse(success = true))
 *   )
 *   .expectWorkflow(
 *     workflowType = ChildWorkflow::class,
 *     key = "child",
 *     assertProps = { assertThat(it.email).isEqualTo("test@foo.com") },
 *     rendering = ChildRendering("message")
 *   )
 *   .render { rendering ->
 *     // This will throw and fail the test because the SubmitLoginWorker is also configured to emit
 *     // an output.
 *     rendering.onCancelClicked()
 * ```
